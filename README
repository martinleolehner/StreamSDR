Usage
-----
You must have a SHOUTcast or Icecast server running.
Modify the config file (streamsdr.conf) to fit to the settings of the
streaming server.

Then execute the main.py script
  $ python main.py

If the webserver port in streamsdr.conf is set to 80 or your rtl-sdr
device requires root privileges you must run the command as root.
